# D-veloppement-carte--lectronique-et-interface-graphiqu

In this project we present the adaptation and improvement of an existing project. 
The project is a reflex game called VAFC React, and we happen to create a graphic interface and improve the existing code. 
Besides, we create mechanical support for the Raspberry Pi graphical interface, 
without forgetting the USB connection between the interface and the central Arduino.
